# UoG Git Contributors
This is a list of students who have contributed to the repository as part of their module.

## Task
1. Take a fork of this repository, adding it to your own GitHub account - [learn how to Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. Get your repository set-up on your local machine by cloning it - [learn how to Clone a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), learn more about the command [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) 
3. Now create a new branch, named whatever you want, and checkout that branch - you can see how to do this at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp?remote=github), learn more about the branch command [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

Once you have successfully forked, cloned and branched your repository then you need to add yourself to the submissions list below - you will need to use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) to add yourself...

1. Once you have added yourself to the file, then you need to commit your change and push it to your remote `git commit -am "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE, CHANGE THIS" && git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>`.
2. Now in GitHub, from your branch with the changes on, you need to create a pull request to submit your change to me - [learn how to create a pull request for a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
